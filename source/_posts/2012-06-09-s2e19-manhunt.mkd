"Oh, Troi's annoying mother. It was about sex. . . Troi's mother was in her midlife? and she was going to pick her husband. She fell in love with someone from the holodeck, she liked Picard, then it was Riker, the Worf I think, and Geordi. She was sad that Wesley was a little boy. She just left after a little while. Ok episode."
