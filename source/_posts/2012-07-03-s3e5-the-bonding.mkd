<blockquote>Well, a crew member dies and she leaves her son behind. Then some person pretends to be his mother and changes the room to look like their home on Earth. Â And then Worf does the weird Klingon ceremony and they both become brothers because they are both orphans. Worf actually starts to show a bit of emotion. Good episode, cute kid.</blockquote>
