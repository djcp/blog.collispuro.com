<blockquote>The starbase that Riker was going to to check out something waves exploded after he left. The scientist guy's wife? and his assistant accused Riker of exploding the base. It was actually the scientist because he didn't like Riker. I don't need to add anything else, I don't want to talk about this episode.</blockquote>
