Don't go to a non-corporate store.  The resellers just don't seem to care about customers as much as the employees at the corporate stores.

I have been lied to (directly!), gotten repeated lame excuses (You JUST missed our tech!) and generally had clueless service.  It's farther and much more annoying to get to a corporate store for me, but the time and frustration saved is worth it. Lessons learned.
