I bet there are about 1000 ways to accidentally kill yourself or others in this book from 1910:Â <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ioNOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false">The Scientific American cyclopedia of formulas</a>.

It includes chapters on fireproofing, bleaching, metallurgy, brazing metals, insecticides(!) and opens (appropriately) with an excellent chapter on first aid in the 1910's.
