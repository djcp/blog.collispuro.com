How many times are you faced with fundamentally meaningless, but "difficult" to
make decisions? Classic examples include choosing what to eat for lunch,
which book to start reading or what movie to see.

Inspired by <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2013/01/31/would-you-let-a-coin-toss-decide-your-future-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-3/">this Freaknomics podcast</a> and conversations around the <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> office, I've written a twitter 'bot to absorb some of that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a> for you.

Tweet @ficklehand a tweet that contains choices separated by "or" or the pipe character (the "|" on your keyboard, for non-programmers). @ficklehand (the "fickle hand of fate") will decide and reply to your tweet.

Example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/djcp">djcp</a> I decide: salad</p>&mdash; ficklehand (@ficklehand) <a href="https://twitter.com/ficklehand/status/298836653810786304">February 5, 2013</a></blockquote>
