I'm a self-identified "geek of all trades" specializing in the deployment and creation of web apps for progressive organizations.

I am an unabashed Free Software zealot, and I'm very fortunate to <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">work at a place</a> dedicated to freedom and that's trying to figure out this internet thing.
