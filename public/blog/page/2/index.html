  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>That&#8217;s a funny name - &#8220;Deja Q.&#8221; So Q comes along again and says he lost all his powers. He&#8217;s really confused, he doesn&#8217;t know how to eat, he gets back pains, he thinks he can order people around. He&#8217;s pretty funny. Some aliens that didn&#8217;t like Q because he tormented them came along and were zapping him, destroying the ship. Q went out into a shuttle and aliens attacked him, but then another Q guy came along and gave Q back his powers because he said he was improving because of his selfless act. It was really funny because they were remarking at each other.</blockquote>

The leader wants Dr. Crusher to help them, but she says she can&#8217;t and gets mad at him. The rebel captures Picard and is going to kill him, then they find the spot and saves everybody. I liked that episode.</blockquote>

The Enterprise just said &#8220;Bye-bye. Your problem!&#8221; when the soldier guy got back on the planet.</blockquote>

Then some person pretends to be his mother and changes the room to look like their home on Earth.  And then Worf does the weird Klingon ceremony and they both become brothers because they are both orphans.

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>So this one had a lot about Vulcans. First time we met Vulcans.  There were some Vulcans that were worshipping Captain Picard because they thought he could bring them back from the dead. Troi and Riker went down and the Vulcans wanted to sacrifice them. Then Riker got away with one of the injured people from the lab explosion but Troi was left behind and they almost sacrificed her. Then they shot Captain Picard and he almost died. I like Vulcans, they brought the Vulcan leader onto the ship and persuaded her that they were all the same and that some day they would have the same powers.</blockquote>

There was a guy and everyone else had been destroyed, he had his wife and later they figured out that he was a powerful being and he had created everything. He was making the song in Troi&#8217;s head so she couldn&#8217;t figure out the truth. I liked it besides poor Troi who had stuff stuck in her head.</blockquote>
